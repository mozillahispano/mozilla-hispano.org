			<question><![CDATA[ Umm, why? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>We needed an elegant remedy to common performance issues we spent countless hours addressing on various blogs we work with. They all suffered from similar issues and we found that same remedies would sort all of them. Issues like <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> transaction reduction, object size reduction and blocking objects are performance killers and have been remedied with this plugin. Rather than release our various plugins individually (and support them independently) we saw an opportunity to demonstrate how all of this functionality is intertwined and combines to realize far more than the sum of its parts.</p>
				<p>One of the WordPress community's strengths is also its weakness; we found that numerous plugins are very handy and save some development time in a pinch, but the maintenance and performance penalties blogs suffer from as a result contribute to a poor user experience, which is never acceptable.</p>
				<p>Experience has shown that fast loading web sites have (at least) the following characteristics:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition" target="_blank">attrition</a></li>
					<li>Higher conversion rates for e-commerce / affiliate etc sites</li>
					<li>Increased time on site / more page views per visitor</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>In fact, if wordpress.com (for example) applied some of the techniques used in this plugin, we imagine they'd realize ~10% performance improvement on the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> and <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> (respectively) on the millions of blogs they host.</em></p>
				<p>As a practical matter, Akamai and JupiterResearch did a study on <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2006/press_110606.html" target="_blank">acceptable wait time for retail web sites</a> to load back in late 2006 concluding that users may leave after 4 seconds of waiting. That was several years ago now, even before 3G was available for mobile devices, what do you think web users expect today? <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3925" target="_blank">According to Marissa Mayer</a> of Google, as she stated the same year as Akamai, improving the speed of sites/applications reduces the learning curve for applications and contributes to higher use. It's time to bring the performance major corporations enjoy to the blogosphere.</p>
				<p>As an aside, don't you think your site's <acronym title="Key Performance Indicators">KPI</acronym> would be more meaningful if you could be confident that all users were having the exact same performance experience with your site? It's too early to say for sure, but we feel that the statistics and metrics we all use to track our progress and results will be more realistic when W3 Total Cache is actively removing bottlenecks from our blogs.</p>

			<question><![CDATA[ So give me the skinny, what are the highlights? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>W3 Total Cache is a suite of functionality designed to optimize the performance of all WordPress blogs. Features and benefits include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Improved progressive render (non-blocking <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> embedding)</li>
					<li>Reduced <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> Transactions, <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym> lookups, reduced document load time</li>
					<li>Transparent content delivery network (<acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>) support with automated media library import</li>
					<li>Bandwidth savings via <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression (<acronym title="GNU zip">gzip</acronym>) for <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym></li>
					<li>Minification (concatenation, white space removal) of inline, external or 3rd party <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> with scheduled updates</li>
					<li>Optional embedding of <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> just above &lt;/body&gt;</li>
					<li>Support for caching pages, posts, feeds, database objects, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> in memory with an opcode cache or memcached or both</li>
					<li>Caching of feeds (comments, page and site), <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URL</acronym>s with query string variables (like search result pages), Database queries, Pages, Posts, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym></li>
					<li>Complete header management including Etags</li>
					<li>Increased web server concurrency and reduced resource consumption, increased scale</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In essence, anything that can be automated to squeeze out every bit of server performance and minimize bandwidth utilization has been done, leaving your readers with an optimized user experience.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ I've never heard of any of this stuff; my blog is fine, no one complains about the speed. Why should I install this? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Rarely do readers take the time to complain. They typically just stop browsing earlier than you'd prefer and may not return altogether. It's in every web site owner's best interest is to make sure that the performance of your blog is not hindering its success.</p> ]]></answer>

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ But even Matt Mullenweg doesn't agree that additional caching is so important, why bother? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>You're right, <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/03/wordpress-is-open-source/#comment-439787" target="_blank">Matt did say that</a>. However, this plugin provides more than just "caching". Because he is correct, the web is dynamic and must remain so. But as we explain throughout this FAQ, our goal is to improve the performance of any blog. Furthermore, some techniques we use are well documented from past <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bazza/high-performance-wordpress" target="_blank">WordCamp presentations</a>; we combined them in a way that we have found stands up to the highest traffic spikes.</p> ]]></answer>

			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>-4 &mdash; That's right; a youngster in junior high school can get started with this plugin. Seriously, if you did your own WordPress install or have ever installed a plugin before you're in good shape.

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ Ok, so the benefits are clear. What exactly is so special about *how* this plugin works? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks for asking. We just decided not try to use the typical WordPress hooks and methodologies to implement our features, instead we take the normal output and perform optimizations to it before we send it to the user agent using a method they support and then cache the result afterwards. This concept is applied to objects you decide to cache.</p> ]]></answer>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ Why would I want to cache my feeds? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>We feel that caching objects after the first request and checking for updates before responding subsequent requests (which is kind of how web browsers work too) creates more opportunities for interesting applications and mashups where the blogosphere doesn't require institutional investment to be able to handle developers making hundreds of requests every day the same way we use Google, Twitter and Facebook (for example) <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>s today. Think about it, even when major search engines crawl your site, they have to be "gentle" so they don't bring it down, let's turn the paradigm around so that every blog can deliver content in real-time in various formats.</p> ]]></answer>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[	Why would I want to put my <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>	at the bottom of the page? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>First let me point out that in many cases we suggest putting all the <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> that's not required for interactivity with your site at the bottom of the document. Anything <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> that makes the site work as intended we suggested embedding in the &lt;head&gt;. Depending on your specific situation, having the majority of your <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> at the bottom of the document will mean that your visitors won't have to download things they don't want to begin interacting with your site or reading it's content. Quite often the additional <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> transaction is worthwhile.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ What's an Etag and why do I need one? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Entity tags were created to add more reliability to client side caching my providing a simple method for a browser to verify that a file had not changed since last it was downloaded. Using them helps enables your server return 304 or "not modified" responses instead of a 200 "ok" response which are much much slower (because the file is sent). The result is a visitor viewing multiple pages of your site would have that "instant loading" experience that we all definitely enjoy. Don't worry we don't use inodes to create our Etags so this solution is reliable for multi server hosting solutions.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ So let me get this straight; you're telling me this plugin is designed to improve performance of any WordPress blog? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Precisely, that is unless you don't write any posts in your blog nor have any readers. If you're someone that's always into the latest web development technique or plugin, now you can "have it all" without making your readers suffer.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ I understand the database caching and the page caching, but	what's minify all about? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
			<p>We'll just quote the fine folks at yahoo on this one:</p>
			<blockquote>
      			<p>"Minification is the practice of removing unnecessary characters from code to reduce its size thereby improving load times. When code is minified all comments are removed, as well as unneeded white space characters (space, newline, and tab). In the case of JavaScript, this improves response time performance because the size of the downloaded file is reduced. Two popular tools for minifying JavaScript code are <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html" target="_blank"><acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>Min</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" target="_blank"><acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym> Compressor</a>. The <acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym> compressor can also minify <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>.</p>
    			<p>Obfuscation is an alternative optimization that can be applied to source code. It's more complex than minification and thus more likely to generate bugs as a result of the obfuscation step itself. In a survey of ten top U.S. web sites, minification achieved a 21% size reduction versus 25% for obfuscation. Although obfuscation has a higher size reduction, minifying JavaScript is less risky.</p>
      			<p>In addition to minifying external scripts and styles, inline &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt; blocks can and should also be minified. Even if you <acronym title="GNU zip">gzip</acronym> your scripts and styles, minifying them will still reduce the size by 5% or more. As the use and size of JavaScript and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> increases so will the savings gained by minifying your code."</p>

			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>  We use: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/" target="_blank">minify</a> but may support various engines in the future. Based on <a href="http://ejohn.org/" target="_blank">John Resig's</a> suggestion we're currently looking at <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yuicompressor/wiki" target="_blank"><acronym title="Yahoo!

			<question><![CDATA[	What's the point of downloading and caching 3rd party files (e.g. <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>)? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>With the various hosted 3rd party applications available (from web site statistics to social media sharing widgets), the problems we've noticed are: additional <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> transactions, <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym> lookups and latencies from busy servers that we can't control and often un-minified files with no <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression all add up to a very slow page load and poor user experience. With your own copy of external files, updated as frequently as you wish, none of these problems exist.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ Will this plugin break my theme by changing the order of conditional statements or the like? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>No, the plugin looks for conditional statements in your markup used for <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> (and sometimes <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>) and makes sure that the minified files precede it, so keep that in mind.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[	Will this speed up <acronym title="WordPress">WP</acronym> Admin? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Yes, indirectly &mdash; if you have a lot of bloggers working with you, you will find that it feels like you have a server dedicated only to <acronym title="WordPress">WP</acronym> Admin once this plugin is enabled; the result, increased productivity.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ Does it really matter if I remove the line breaks from my code? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Definitely. Removing white space from your files make <acronym title="GNU zip">gzip</acronym> (<acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression) more effective.</p> ]]></answer>

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[	What's the benefit of removing <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> comments from my code? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Many developers like to have comments in the code for various reasons, however these comments add no value from the blog readers (or search engine for that matter) point of view and only contribute to increased load time and wasted bandwidth as a result. Now only you can use them and view them in your site (as a logged in administrator viewing the page source), which is really what (we assume) you intended.</p> ]]></answer>

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ Why do I care of <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> or <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> is "blocking" or not? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>In the case of objects (files) you don't host yourself, this could add several seconds to your page's load time as the <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym> lookups, <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> transaction roundtrip times and wait times add up. Even when all the scripts are hosted locally, the same adversities exist. Since all objects in the &lt;head&gt; of a document have to be ready before the page can be rendered, having them load in a parallel fashion as opposed to linear (or near linear) gives night and day results.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ Ok I get it, this all sounds nice and everything, but is this perfect? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Pretty much. If you monetize your blog with ads you will want to spend some time making sure that the ad code works well with your optimization settings. There are also the occasional pieces of code that conflict with the others and have to be in a specific order to work well, but that's not a problem that this plugin introduces.</p> ]]></answer>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ Seriously, tell me what the downside is, there must be something? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Well, no there isn't. Installing the server side software might be challenging for some, but <a href="mailto:wordpressexperts@w3-edge.com">we can assist</a> with that if you ask. Other than that, unless you enjoy frequently upgrading your server plan or buying more servers and paying for bandwidth overages or wincing every time you add another "must have" plugin to your blog, we cannot find any reason to deter you from the use of this one.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ If this plugin does everything you claim, why would you	give it away free? Cui Bono? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>Who benefits? Everyone. Of the numerous, here are the three the most important reasons we share with the WordPress community:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WordPress is free and high quality, plugins should be too.</li>
					<li>There's no reason your blog shouldn't be able to perform as well as well as any major corporation's web site/application.</li>
					<li><a href="http://code.google.com/speed/articles/" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a> offer quite a bit, but they did not offer a WordPress solution yet.

			<question><![CDATA[	I don't understand what a <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> has to do with caching, that's completely different, no? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Technically no, a <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> is a high performance cache that stores static assets (your theme files, media library etc) in various locations throughout the world in order to provide low latency access to them by readers in those regions.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ We run many blogs on many servers here at my company, is this plugin still for me? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>  Yes, especially if you have a cluster and many WordPress installations or a WordPress <acronym title="Multi-User">MU</acronym> installation, then plugin is for you. It will allow you to move easily from multiple installations to WordPress <acronym title="Multi-User">MU</acronym> and continue to use multiple <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>, Database, Network Attached Storage etc servers in any configuration you wish. You can also specify as many memcached servers as you wish, although you cannot yet delegate a memcached server to a specific type of caching, i.e. there's no pool management yet.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ So you appear to know what you're talking about, will there be any negative effect on my SEO rankings? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[
				<p>To answer, first we must assume that you're using all of the options we offer: <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression, minify etc. Having said that, we are only sending compressed data to user agents that support it; even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=search+engine+crawler+http+compression" target="_blank">most search engine crawlers do</a>. As for minified <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, this is essentially how crawlers see your page anyway when they download it. So no, there's no penalty or compromise.</p>
    			<p>Fact of the matter, there was a time when the semantics and size of your <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> file (code-to-content ratio), was a factor in a more favorable ranking. <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/posh" target="_blank"><acronym title="Plain Old Semantic HTML">POSH</acronym></a> <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> has always been preferred by search engines. In some markets this may still be true, so give the search engines what they want.</p>

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ What about my robots.txt, sitemap.xml and all my site verification files etc, what happens with those? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>If you're concerned about what happens with these when the <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> functionality is active, nothing does. You do not want or need these files moved from their original locations and <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression (or minification for that matter) is of no consequence in most cases.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ Do you have any tricks for "post-loading", "lazy-loading" and other render optimizations in this plugin? ]]></question>

		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ I want to obfuscate my <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>, does the plugin do that? Will it ever? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>No the plugin will not do that and it's unlikely that we'll support that.</p> ]]></answer>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<question><![CDATA[ Can I use packed or obfuscated <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> with this plugin? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>  Yes and no. In general, packed <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> cannot be minified reliably. Obfuscated <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> also is hit or miss. A minified and <acronym title="GNU zip">gzip</acronym>ped <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> file will be smaller than a packed file in any case, so using the (uncompressed, unpacked or un obfuscated) developer versions of your plugins is no longer a concern when using this plugin. Alternatively, you can use the non-blocking embed option to continue to use your packed or obfuscated file without minification.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[	How do I find the <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>	to optimize (manually minify) them with this plugin? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>View your page source in your browser and search for any &lt;style&gt;, &lt;link&gt; or &lt;script&gt; tags that contain external <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> or <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> files and one by one add them to the minify settings page. Do not include any <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> in conditional statements (unless you know what you are doing) like:</p>
    			<p>&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/wp-content/themes/default/lte.css&quot; media=&quot;screen,projection&quot; /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt; Or simply use the "Help" tool available on the minify settings page which will identify <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> files used in the templates of your theme and properly assign them to the same. Simply tick the checkbox for files you wish to minify, click "Apply &amp; close", then save your settings.</p>
  				<p>The plugin will combine, minify, <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compress and check for updates to these files automatically from now on. If you have any <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> or <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> that are inline consider making them external files so that you can use them with minify.</p>

			<question><![CDATA[ How do I configure Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon <acronym title="Simple Storage Service">S3</acronym>) or Amazon CloudFront as my <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>First <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">create an S3 account</a>; it may take several hours for your account credentials to be functional. Next, you need to obtain your "Access key ID" and "Secret key" from the "Access Credentials" section of the "<a href="http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key" target="_blank">Security Credentials</a>" page of "My Account." Make sure the status is "active." Next, make sure that "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)" is the selected "<acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> type" on the "General Settings" tab, then save the changes. Now on the "Content Delivery Network Settings" tab enter your "Access key," "Secret key" and enter a name (avoid special characters and spaces) for your bucket in the "Create a bucket" field by clicking the button of the same name. If using an existing bucket simply specify the bucket name in the "Bucket" field. Click the "Test <acronym title="Simple Storage Service">S3</acronym> Upload" button and make sure that the test is successful, if not check your settings and try again. Save your settings.</p>
				<p>Unless you wish to use CloudFront, you're almost done, skip to the next paragraph if you're using CloudFront. Go to the "General Settings" tab and click the "Enable" checkbox and save the settings to enable <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> functionality. Empty the cache for the changes to take effect. If preview mode is active you will need to "deploy" your changes for them to take effect.</p>
				<p>To use CloudFront, perform all of the steps above, except select the "Amazon CloudFront" "<acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> type" in the "Content Delivery Network" section of the "General Settings" tab. When creating a new bucket, the distribution ID will automatically be populated. Otherwise, proceed to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank"><acronym title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</acronym> Management Console</a> and create a new distribution: select the S3 Bucket you created earlier as the "Origin," enter a <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?CNAMEs.html" target="_blank"><acronym title="Canonical Name">CNAME</acronym></a> if you wish to add one or more to your DNS Zone. Make sure that "Distribution Status" is deployed and "State" is enabled. Now on "Content Delivery Network" tab of the plugin, copy the subdomain found in the <acronym title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</acronym> Management Console and enter the <acronym title="Canonical Name">CNAME</acronym> used for the distribution in the "<acronym title="Canonical Name">CNAME</acronym>" field.</p>
				<p>You may optionally, specify up to 10 hostnames to use rather than the default hostname, doing so will improve the render performance of your site's pages. Additional hostnames should also be specified in the settings for the distribution you're using in the <acronym title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</acronym> Management Console.</p>
				<p>Now go to the General tab and click the "Enable" checkbox and save the settings to enable <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect. If preview mode is active you will need to "deploy" your changes for them to take effect.</p>

			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>Login to your <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> providers control panel or account management area. Following any set up steps they provide, create a new "pull zone" or "bucket" for your site's domain name.

In the "Content Delivery Network" tab of the plugin, enter the hostname your <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> provider provided in the "replace site's hostname with" field. You should always do a quick check by opening a test file from the <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> hostname, e.g. http://cdn.domain.com/favicon.ico. Troubleshoot with yoru <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> provider until this test is successful.</p>

			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Yes! You can take advantage of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/http/pipelining-faq.html">pipelining</a> support in some browsers by creating a sub-domain for the static content for your site. So you could select the "Origin Push / Self-hosted" method of the General Settings tab. Create static.domain.com on your server (and update your <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym> zone) and then specify the <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> details for it in the plugin configuration panel and you're done. If you disable the scripting options on your server you'll find that your server will actually respond slightly faster from that sub-domain because it's just sending files and not processing them.</p> ]]></answer>

Files like "http://domain.com/wp-content/themes/default/js/script.js?ver=20090102" etc need to be specified with the full <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>.

			<question><![CDATA[ My YSlow score is low because it doesn't recognize my <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>, what can I do? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[
				<p>Rule 2 says to use a content delivery network (<acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>). The score for this rule is computed by checking the hostname of each component against the list of known <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>s. Unfortunately, the list of "known <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>s" are the ones used by Yahoo!. Most likely these are not relevant to your web site, except for potentially yui.yahooapis.com. If you want an accurate score for your web site, you can add your <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> hostnames to YSlow using Firefox's preferences. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to about:config in Firefox. You'll see the current list of preferences.</li>
					<li>Right-click in the window and choose New and String to create a new string preference.</li>
					<li>Enter extensions.yslow.cdnHostnames for the preference name.</li>
					<li>For the string value, enter the hostname of your <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym>, for example, mycdn.com. Do not use quotes. If you have multiple <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> hostnames, separate them with commas.</li>
				</ul>

            <answer> <![CDATA[
                <p>Great question. W3 Total Cache uses several open source tools to attempt to combine and optimize <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, JavaScript and <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> etc. Unfortunately some trial and error is required on the part of developers is required to make sure that their code can be successfully minified with the various libraries W3 Total Cache supports. Even still, if developers do test their code thoroughly, they cannot be sure that interoperability with other code your site may have. This fault does not lie with any single party here, because there are thousands of plugins and theme combinations that a given site can have, there are millions of possible combinations of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, JavaScript etc.</p>
                <p>A good rule of thumb is to try auto mode, work with a developer to identify the code that is not compatible and start with combine only mode (the safest optimization) and increase the optimization to the point just before functionality (JavaScript) or user interface / layout (<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>) breaks in your site.</p>
                <p>We're always working to make this more simple and straight forward in future releases, but this is not an undertaking we can realize on our own. When you find a plugin, theme or file that is not compatible with minification reach out to the developer and ask them either to provide a minified version with their distribution or otherwise make sure their code is minification-friendly.</p>

			<question><![CDATA[ Do I need to enable mod_gzip, mod_rewrite or install any <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression software on my server? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[
				<p>Not when the option is enabled for page caching or minfiied files, however you do need either module to compress files that are not handled by W3 Total Cache.</p>
				<p>If you're larger organization or a web hosting company, consider looking into solutions that exist like <a href="http://www.gear6.com/">Gear6</a> which could be useful now that you have a plugin that makes management memcached pain free.</p>

			<question><![CDATA[ My server is state of the art with 15,000 RPM RAID, why do I need to cache anything in memory? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Even if your server was using an array of solid state disks (SSD), your server's <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> is still going to be faster and introduce less overhead to access than even the fastest solid state drives on a PCIe bus. If you didn't invest in solid state disks for your server, then even worse off - at least an order of magnitude speed difference in read operations in <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> versus HDD. For write operations delta the latency differences is even more pronounced. <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym> is the winner hands down. We won't even discuss the blocking and arbitration issues that happen with disk arrays under certain circumstances.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ Why would I choose opcode caching over memcached or vice versa? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ 
				<p>There's no straight answer for this one. Since WordPress is a PHP-based application, we encourage everyone to install an opcode cache and realize a minimum of 10x performance gain. It will obviously make our plugin faster as well, so again please check out the installation instructions if you do not already use an opcode cache. Once installed, you can select an opcode cache as the method and get back to blogging.</p>
				<p>Opcode caching does have a couple weaknesses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you frequently restart your web server (e.g. apache) especially during high traffic periods, you will lose your cache and your site will slow down as it rebuilds the cache (which happens very quickly). However if you use memcached you would not lose your cache if your web server is restarted.</li>
					<li>More importantly, opcode caching is best suited for single server environments because the cache is only accessible to the local server, it cannot be shared with other servers in a multi-server (cluster) environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It would appear that using <acronym title="Alternative PHP Cache">APC</acronym> database caching may be best, but your mileage may vary. So depending on what software you install and how you manage your server, you can choose the options to fit your needs. If you need help with the install on your dedicated or virtual dedicated linux-based server ask us!</p>

			<question><![CDATA[	I already use <acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> compression on my server, why does it matter if I minify my code? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>Let's say you had a file of 10240 bytes, which becomes 2048 bytes when compressed, savings of ~80% (typical for <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> files). That same file will now have an <strong>additional</strong> ~3x-10x transfer speed improvement when minified. That's a big return from a small operation. The larger your files, the more significant the proportional performance gains.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[	How much memory (<acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym>) do I need to delegate to caching? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[
				<p>Probably the hardest question of all. At the time of this writing the default WordPress install and theme will consume about 50MB of memory in an opcode cache while running our plugin. Keep in mind that the following factors will determine the minimum size of your cache beyond this noted 50MB:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Number of typically requested pages per day (if your blog is popular this number is quite large)</li>
				<li>Size of minified <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> and <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> pages (smaller is better)</li>
				<li>Number and complexity of plugins active on your blog (fewer is better)</li>
				<li>Expiry time of the cache (larger expiry time, larger cache)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So we recommend an absolute minimum of 128MB for a typical blog; this figure is greater than some defaults, so keep that in mind. With statistics you'll be able to react accordingly and make adjustments.</p>
				<p>For those that don't want or have time to learn anything new to get started, sample configuration files are included with the plugin containing inline comments for you.</p>

			<question><![CDATA[ What version of	<acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> do I need for this thing? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>  Version 4.3 is supported for some modules, however version 5 preferred (it's much much faster especially with an opcode cache). It is likely version 3.0 of WordPress will no longer support <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> 4.3.</p> ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[ What is the intended impact of this plugin on the web hosting landscape? ]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[ <p>We feel that shared or virtual hosting providers will begin offering secure containers (similar to what <a href="http://mediatemple.net/" target="_blank">mediatemple.net</a> does for mySQL and Ruby etc) for opcode caching and memcached. Whoever brings this offering to market first will lower the bar for more web sites/applications (and startups) to build better performing applications with greater ease. The same hosting provider would also possess a new value added service, thereby realizing a competitive advantage in a highly competitive marketplace. Not to mention be able to increase the density of domains per server (or cluster) without shortchanging customers.</p>  <p>One day hopefully this plugin will contribute to making web servers greener and reduce the ecological footprint of the web by reducing the computational effort required to deliver high performance rich user experiences.</p> ]]></answer>

== Description ==

Yet Another Related Posts Plugin (YARPP) gives you a list of posts and/or pages related to the current entry, introducing the reader to other relevant content on your site.

1. **Thumbnails**: a beautiful new thumbnail display, for themes which use post thumbnails (featured images) **New in YARPP 4!**
2. **Related posts, pages, and custom post types**: [Learn about CPT support](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/other_notes/).
3. **Templating**: The [YARPP templating system](http://mitcho.com/blog/projects/yarpp-3-templates/) gives you advanced control of how your results are displayed.
4. **An advanced and versatile algorithm**: Using a customizable algorithm considering post titles, content, tags, categories, and custom taxonomies, YARPP finds related content from across your site. [Learn more](http://wordpress.tv/2011/01/29/michael-%E2%80%9Cmitcho%E2%80%9D-erlewine-the-yet-another-related-posts-plugin-algorithm-explained/).
5. **Caching**: YARPP is performant, caching related posts data as your site is visited.
6. **Related posts in feeds**: Display related posts in RSS feeds with custom display options.

This plugin requires PHP 5, MySQL 4.1, and WordPress 3.3 or greater.

= A note on support (June 2010) =

I have begun instituting a stricter policy of not responding to support inquiries via email, instead directing senders to the appropriate WordPress.org forum, [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yet-another-related-posts-plugin).

I try to respond to inquiries on the forums on a regular basis and hope to build a community of users who can learn from each other's questions and experiences and can support one another. I ask for your understanding on this matter.

= Testimonials =

<blockquote>
"One of my favorite [plugin]s I just activated on my blog is called Yet Another Related Posts Plugin... I've been blogging seven or eight years now so I have a lot of archives, and it actually surprises me sometimes when I blog about something and I visit the permalink to see I've written about it before... and it also increases the traffic on your blog because when they come in just to one entry, they'll see this other stuff going on."
</blockquote>

&mdash; [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt), WordPress creator

<blockquote>
"The first one I ended up trying was Yet Another Related Posts Plugin (YARPP), and mitcho has really done a fantastic job on it:

<ul>
<li>It’s trivial to install.</li>
<li>You don’t have to edit your WordPress template.</li>
<li>The relevance is good: the suggested posts are related, and you can tweak thresholds and how things are computed if you want."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

&mdash; [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wordpress-plugin-related-posts/), head of Webspam, Google

<blockquote>
"One way of getting search engines to get to your older content a bit easier, thus increasing your WordPress SEO capabilites a LOT, is by using a related posts plugin. These plugins search through your posts database to find posts with the same subject, and add links to these posts. There are quite a few related posts plugins but I tend to stick with the Yet Another Related Posts Plugin..."
</blockquote>

&mdash; [Yoast (Joost de Valk)](http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/)

== Installation ==

= Auto display on your website =

1. Copy the folder `yet-another-related-posts-plugin` into the directory `wp-content/plugins/` and activate the plugin.
2. (optionally) copy the sample template files inside the `yarpp-templates` folder into your active theme.
3. Go to the "Related Posts (YARPP)" settings page to customize YARPP.

= Auto display in your feeds =

Make sure the "display related posts in feeds" option is turned on if you would like to show related posts in your RSS and Atom feeds. The "display related posts in feeds" option can be used regardless of whether you auto display them on your website (and vice versa).

= Widget =

Related posts can also be displayed as a widget. Go to the Design > Widgets options page and add the Related Posts widget. The widget will only be displayed on single entry (permalink) pages. The widget can be used even if the "auto display" option is turned off.

= Custom display through templates =

YARPP allows the advanced user with knowledge of PHP to customize the display of related posts using a templating mechanism. More information is available [in this tutorial](http://mitcho.com/blog/projects/yarpp-3-templates/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If your question isn't here, ask your own question at [the WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yet-another-related-posts-plugin). *Please do not email with questions.*

= How can I move the related posts display? =

If you do not want to show the Related Posts display in its default position (right below the post content), first go to YARPP options and turn off the "automatically display" options in the "website" section. If you would like to instead display it in your sidebar and you have a widget-aware theme, YARPP provides a Related Posts widget which you can add under "Appearance" > "Widgets".

If you would like to add the Related Posts display elsewhere, edit your relevant theme file (most likely something like `single.php`) and add the PHP code `related_posts();` within [The Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) where you want to display the related posts.

= I'm using the Thumbnails display in YARPP 4. How can I change the thumbnail size? =

The thumbnail size can be specified programmatically by adding `add_image_size( 'yarpp-thumbnail', $width, $height, true );` to your theme's `functions.php` file with appropriate width and height variables. In the future I may add some UI to the settings to also set this... feedback is requested on whether this is a good idea.

Each time you change YARPP's thumbnail dimensions like this, you will probably want to have WordPress regenerate appropriate sized thumbnails for all of your images. I highly recommend the [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin for this purpose. See also the next question.

= I'm using the Thumbnails display in YARPP 4. Why aren't the right size thumbnails being served? =

By default if an appropriately sized thumbnail is not available in WordPress, a larger image will be served and will be made to fit in the thumbnail space via CSS. Sometimes this means images will be scaled down in a weird way, so it is not ideal... what you really want is for YARPP to serve appropriately-sized thumbnails.

There are two options for doing so:

* First, you can use the [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin to generate all these thumbnail-sized images in a batch process. This puts you in control of when this resizing process happens on your server (which is good because it can be processor-intensive). New images which are uploaded to WordPress should automatically get the appropriate thumbnail generated when the image is uploaded.

* Second, you can turn on a feature in YARPP to auto-generate appropriate size thumbnails on the fly, if they have not yet been created. Doing this type of processing on the fly does not scale well, so this feature is turned off by default. But if you run a smaller site with less traffic, it may work for you. Simply add `define('YARPP_GENERATE_THUMBNAILS', true);` to your theme's `functions.php` file.

= How can I use the custom template feature? =

YARPP's [custom templates feature](http://mitcho.com/blog/projects/yarpp-3-templates/) allows you to uber-customize the related posts display using the same coding conventions and [Template Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) as in WordPress themes. Custom templates must be in your *active theme's main directory* in order to be recognized by YARPP. If your theme did not ship with YARPP templates, move the files in the `yarpp-templates` directory which ships with YARPP into your active theme's main directory. Be sure to move the *files* (which must be named `yarpp-template-`...`.php`) to your theme, not the entire directory.

= Does YARPP slow down my blog/server? =

The YARPP calculation of related content does make a little impact, yes. However, YARPP caches all of its results, so any post's results need only be calculated once. YARPP's queries have been significantly optimized in version 3.5.

If you are running a large site and need to throttle YARPP's computation, try the official [YARPP Experiments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin which adds this throttling functionality. If you are looking for a hosting provider whose databases will not balk under YARPP, I personally have had great success with [MediaTemple](http://www.mediatemple.net/#a_aid=4ed59d7ac5dae).

= Many pages list "no related posts". =

Most likely you have "no related posts" right now as the default "match threshold" is too high. Here's what I recommend to find an appropriate match threshold: lower your match threshold in the YARPP options to something very low, like 1. (If you don't see the match threshold, you may need to display the "Relatedness" options via the "Screen Options" tab at the top.) Most likely the really low threshold will pull up many posts that aren't actually related (false positives), so look at some of your posts' related posts and their match scores. This will help you find an appropriate threshold. You want it lower than what you have now, but high enough so it doesn't have many false positives.

= Are there any plugins that are incompatible with YARPP? =

* [DISQUS](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/): go to the DISQUS plugin advanced settings and turn on the "Check this if you have a problem with comment counts not showing on permalinks".
* [SEO_Pager plugin](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/267966): turn off the automatic display option in SEO Pager and instead add the code manually.
* [Pagebar 2](http://www.elektroelch.de/hacks/wp/pagebar/);
* [WP Contact Form III plugin and Contact Form Plugin](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/392605);
* Other related posts plugins, obviously, may also be incompatible.

Please submit similar bugs by starting a new thread on [the WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yet-another-related-posts-plugin). I check the forums regularly and will try to release a quick bugfix.

= Does YARPP work with full-width characters or languages that don't use spaces between words? =

YARPP works fine with full-width (double-byte) characters, assuming your WordPress database is set up with Unicode support. 99% of the time, if you're able to write blog posts with full-width characters and they're displayed correctly, YARPP will work on your blog.

However, YARPP does have difficulty with languages that don't place spaces between words (Chinese, Japanese, etc.). For these languages, the "consider body" and "consider titles" options in the "Relatedness options" may not be very helpful. Using only tags and categories may work better for these languages.

= Things are weird after I upgraded. =

1. Visit the "Related Posts (YARPP)" settings page to verify your settings.
2. Disactivate YARPP, replace the YARPP files on the server with a fresh copy of the new version, and then reactivate it.
3. Install the official [YARPP Experiments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin to flush the cache.

= Can I clear my cache? Can I build up the cache manually? =

The official [YARPP Experiments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin adds manual cache controls, letting you flush the cache and build it up manually.

== Developing with YARPP ==

= Custom post types =

To make YARPP support your custom post type, the attribute `yarpp_support` must be set to true on the custom post type when it is registered. It will then be available on options on the YARPP settings page.

If you would like to programmatically control which post types are considered in an automatically-displayed related posts display, use the `yarpp_map_post_types` filter.

= Custom displays =

Developers can call YARPP's powerful relatedness algorithm from anywhere in their own code. Some examples and more details are in [my slides from my WordCamp Birmingham talk](http://www.slideshare.net/mitcho/relate-all-the-things).

	yarpp_related(array(
		// Pool options: these determine the "pool" of entities which are considered
		'post_type' => array('post', 'page', ...),
		'show_pass_post' => false, // show password-protected posts
		'past_only' => false, // show only posts which were published before the reference post
		'exclude' => array(), // a list of term_taxonomy_ids. entities with any of these terms will be excluded from consideration.
		'recent' => false, // to limit to entries published recently, set to something like '15 day', '20 week', or '12 month'.
		
		// Relatedness options: these determine how "relatedness" is computed
		// Weights are used to construct the "match score" between candidates and the reference post
		'weight' => array(
			'body' => 1,
			'title' => 2, // larger weights mean this criteria will be weighted more heavily
			'tax' => array(
				'post_tag' => 1,
				... // put any taxonomies you want to consider here with their weights
			)
		),
		// Specify taxonomies and a number here to require that a certain number be shared:
		'require_tax' => array(
			'post_tag' => 1 // for example, this requires all results to have at least one 'post_tag' in common.
		),
		// The threshold which must be met by the "match score"
		'threshold' => 5,
	
		// Display options:
		'template' => , // either the name of a file in your active theme or the boolean false to use the builtin template
		'limit' => 5, // maximum number of results
		'order' => 'score DESC'
	),
	$reference_ID, // second argument: (optional) the post ID. If not included, it will use the current post.
	true); // third argument: (optional) true to echo the HTML block; false to return it

Options which are not specified will default to those specified in the YARPP settings page. Additionally, if you are using the builtin template rather than specifying a custom template file in `template`, the following arguments can be used to override the various parts of the builtin template: `before_title`, `after_title`, `before_post`, `after_post`, `before_related`, `after_related`, `no_results`, `excerpt_length`.

If you need to use related entries programmatically or to know whether they exist, you can use the functions `yarpp_get_related($args, $reference_ID)` and `yarpp_related_exist($args, $reference_ID)`. `yarpp_get_related` returns an array of `post` objects, just like the WordPress function `get_posts`. `yarpp_related_exist` returns a boolean for whether any such related entries exist. For each function, `$args` takes the same arguments as those shown for `yarpp_related` above, except for the various display and template options.

Note that custom YARPP queries using the functions mentioned here are *not* cached in the built-in YARPP caching system. Thus, if you notice any performance hits, you may need to write your own code to cache the results.

= Custom taxonomy support =

Any taxonomy, including custom taxonomies, may be specified in the `weight` or `require_tax` arguments in a custom display as above. `term_taxonomy_id`s specified in the `exclude` argument may be of any taxonomy.

If you would like to choose custom taxonomies to choose in the YARPP settings UI, either to exclude certain terms or to consider them in the relatedness formula via the UI, the taxonomy must (a) have either the `show_ui` or `yarpp_support` attribute set to true and (b) must apply to either the post types `post` or `page` or both.

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.6 =
* YARPP's automatic display will not run on posts which include the HTML comment `<!--noyarpp-->` [by request](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/disabling-yarrp-on-specific-pages).
* More robust activation handling, particularly when network-activated.
* Improved handling of exceptions, for example when fulltext indexes cannot be created or non-MyISAM tables are used.
* YARPP no longer triggers the generation of YARPP-thumbnail-sized images (120x120) when YARPP thumbnails are not used.
	* If you are using YARPP programmatically and using the thumbnails view and having troubles with YARPP's thumbnail size being registered, a manual control to force image size registration has been added to the [YARPP Experiments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin.
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yarpp_related_exist-and-begin_yarpp_time-error): calls to `yarpp_related_exist()` type functions were causing errors.
* Bundled `yarpp-template-wpml.php` is now called `yarpp-template-multilingual.php`, following [discussion with the author of the Polylang plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/better-integration-of-yarpp-and-polylang).

	* Code to generate thumbnails of appropriate size on the fly has been added, but is turned off by default for performance reasons (see FAQ)
* Bugfix: a class of `yarpp-related-` with a stray hyphen was sometimes being produced. Now fixed so it produces `yarpp-related`.
* [Bugfix](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-in-sql-function-in-yarpp_cache): `term_relationships` table was being joined when unnecessary
* [Bugfix](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-option-to-add-widget-title-in-theme-using-hybrid-core-framework): widget options would not display if custom templates were not available
* Bugfix: some transients expired too soon if object caching was used
* The `yarpp_map_post_types` filter now also applies to feeds and takes an extra argument to know whether the context is `website` or `rss`.

= 4.0 =
* New thumbnail template option!
	* No PHP required—just visit the settings page
	* Edit your theme's CSS file to modify the styling
* Auto display settings changes:
	* Easily choose which post types you want related posts to display on
	* Added an "also display in archives" option

* Changes to the output HTML:
	* All YARPP output is now wrapped in a `div` with class `yarpp-related`, `yarpp-related-widget`, or `yarpp-related-rss` as appropriate ([by request](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/adding-a-main-div-to-default-template)). If there are no results, a `yarpp-related-none` class is added.
	* The "related posts brought to you by YARPP" text is only added if there were results.
* Refinements to settings UI:
	* A new design for the template chooser
	* Example code display is now hidden by default; turn them back on from the "screen options" tab.
	* A new "copy templates" button allows one-button installation of bundled templates into the current theme, if filesystem permissions make it possible.
	* Header information in YARPP custom templates are now displayed to users in the settings UI. Available fields are `YARPP Template`, `Description`, `Author`, `Author URI`, in the same format as plugin and theme file headers. See bundled templates for examples.
* Code cleanup:
	* Settings screen UI have been rewritten to use `div`s rather than `table`s!
	* Inline help in settings screen now use WordPress pointers
	* Removed keyword cache table, as it does not ctually improve performance much and the overhead of an additional table is not worth it.
* Default option changes:
	* Default result count is now 4
	* Default match threshold is now 4
	* Default for "before related entries" heading uses `h3` instead of `p`
* Added `yarpp_map_post_types` filter to programmatically specify what post types should be looked at for automatic displays

	* This was due to an issue with [object references in PHP4](http://www.obdev.at/developers/articles/00002.html). What a pain!

* Better caching performance:
  * Previously, the cache would never actually build up properly. This is now fixed. Thanks to Artefact for pointing this out.
  * The appropriate caches are cleared after posts are deleted ([#1245](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1245)).
  * Caching is no longer performed while batch-importing posts.
* A new object-based abstraction for the caching system. YARPP by default uses custom database tables (same behavior as 3.1.x), but you now have an option to use the `postmeta` table instead. To use `postmeta` caching, add `define('YARPP_CACHE_TYPE', 'postmeta');` to your `wp-config.php` file.<!--YARPP no longer uses custom tables! Both custom tables (`yarpp_related_cache` and `yarpp_keywords_cache`) are automatically removed if you have them. WordPress Post Meta is used instead for caching.-->

= 3.1.9 =

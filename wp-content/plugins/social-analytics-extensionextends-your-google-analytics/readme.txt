== Description ==
 Extend your Google Analytics to track social buttons like the Facebook "like" , the Twitter "Tweet".  This plugin only contains additional script for Google Analytics.  So you need embed google analytics by yourself with another way. If your Analytics supports social tracking, please do not install it.

I recommend these plugins with it:

[Google Analytics for WordPress](http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/#utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=google-analytics-for-wordpress&utm_content=v411) to track with Google Analytics.

[WP Social Bookmarking Light](http://www.ninxit.com/blog/2010/06/13/wp-social-bookmarking-light/) for placing social buttons.


See http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSocial.html for detail.

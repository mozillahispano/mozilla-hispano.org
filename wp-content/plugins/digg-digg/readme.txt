= How can I disable the Digg Digg Floating Bar on a particular page? =

You can insert the following within the HTML editor anywhere when editing a post and it will disable Digg Digg on that page.

`<!-- Digg Digg Disabled -->`

Another method to disable the bar on a particular page add the following few lines to your themes functions.php file, changing the conditional tags to ones that fit your requirement.

`function dd_exclude_from_pages() {
if(is_page(1)) {
      remove_filter('the_excerpt', 'dd_hook_wp_content');
    	remove_filter('the_content', 'dd_hook_wp_content');
	}
}
add_action('template_redirect', 'dd_exclude_from_pages');`

= How can I add the Digg Digg Floating Bar on a particular page? =

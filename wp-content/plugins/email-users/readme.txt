== Description ==

== Custom Filter Usage ==

Email Users provides the ability to send email to a very specific set of users using a custom meta filter.  To create a special mail list, you will need to add something similar to the following to your theme's functions.php file or create a separate plugin file.

The mailusers_register_user_custom_meta_filter() and mailusers_register_group_custom_meta_filter() actions each take 3-4 parameters:
1.  Label - text that will appear on the WordPress Email-Users menu (users) or in the Recipient List (groups).
1.  Meta Key - the meta key to search for in the user meta table.
1.  Meta Value - the value to match against in the user meta table.
1.  Meta Compare - optional, defaults to '='.  The type of comparison to be performed.

This example will filter the user list to only those users where the first name is Alex.
`
add_action( 'mailusers_user_custom_meta_filter', 'first_name_alex', 5 );

function first_name_alex()
{
    mailusers_register_user_custom_meta_filter('First Name: Alex', 'first_name', 'Alex');
}
`

Regular SQL comparisons (=, !=, etc.) can be performed.  Wildcard matches (LIKE, NOT LIKE) are not yet supported due to how the WordPress get_users() API currently handles LIKE comparison.  A patch has been submitted and hopefully it will be addressed in WordPress 3.6.  Once addressed, you will be able to create filters like the one below to specifically match last names which begin with the letter M.

`
add_action( 'mailusers_user_custom_meta_filter', 'last_names_starting_with_m', 5 );

function last_names_starting_with_m()
{
    mailusers_register_user_custom_meta_filter('Last Name: M', 'last_name', 'M%', 'LIKE');
}
`

In addition to filtering on User Meta data to build a custom list of users, you can now define custom groups based on User Meta data.

`
add_action( 'mailusers_group_custom_meta_filter', 'send_to_fire_department', 5 );

function send_to_fire_department()
{
    mailusers_register_group_custom_meta_filter('Fire Department', 'department', 'fire');
}


add_action( 'mailusers_group_custom_meta_filter', 'send_to_police_department', 5 );

function send_to_police_department()
{
    mailusers_register_group_custom_meta_filter('Police Department', 'department', 'police');
}
`

In addition to defining specific Meta Key and Value pairs, Email Users also supports a filter to generate the Meta Group filters based on a Meta Key.  The Meta Key filter supports two optional arguments - a Meta Value and a function callback to generate the label.  Neither is required.  When the label callback is used, it receives two arguments, both strings, the Meta Key and Meta Value.  It must return a string.

`
//  Define action to send to blog followers
add_action( 'mailusers_group_custom_meta_key_filter', 'send_to_my_blog_followers', 5 );

function send_to_my_blog_followers()
{
    mailusers_register_group_custom_meta_key_filter('blog_follower');
}

function send_to_departments_label($mk, $mv)
{
    return(ucwords($mk) . ' = ' . ucwords($mv)) ;
}

//  Define action to send to departments using custom callback to generate the label
add_action( 'mailusers_group_custom_meta_key_filter', 'send_to_departments', 5 );

function send_to_departments()
{
    mailusers_register_group_custom_meta_key_filter('department', null, 'send_to_departments_label');
}

function send_to_departments_label($mk, $mv)
{
    return(ucwords($mk) . ' = ' . ucwords($mv)) ;
}

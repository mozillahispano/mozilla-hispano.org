/**
 * Sets up the storage backend currently selected in LocalSettings.php
 * (or the default MySQL store if no other store was selected). This
 * is equivalent to clicking the respective button on the page
 * Special:SMWAdmin. However, the latter may timeout if the setup involves
 * migrating a lot of existing data.
 *
 * Note: if SMW is not installed in its standard path under ./extensions
 *       then the MW_INSTALL_PATH environment variable must be set.
 *       See README in the maintenance directory.
 *
 * Note: For people still using MediaWiki 1.16.x, there is the SMW_setup_1.16.php script.
 *
 * Usage:
 * php SMW_refreshData.php [options...]
 *
 * -password Password for user account
 * NOTE: specifying user credentials in a command line call will usually store them
 * within the shell history file. For security, provide credentials in Adminssetings.php
 * instead and ensure that your text editor does not create world-readable backup copies
 * when modifying this file.
 *
 * --delete   Delete all SMW data, uninstall the selected storage backend. This is useful
 *            when moving to a new storage engine, and in the rare case of unsinstalling
 *            SMW. Deleted data can be recreated using this script (setup) and
 *            SMW_refreshData.php but this may take some time.

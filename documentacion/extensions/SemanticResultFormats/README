= Semantic Result Formats =

Semantic Result Formats is an extension to MediaWiki that bundles a number of
result formats for Semantic MediaWiki's inline queries. The individual formats
can be added to the installation independently. This file contains an
overview on how to install and configure the formats, as well as an overview
of all included formats.

Semantic Result Formats requires Semantic MediaWiki to run, at least at the
same second-level version number as Semantic Result Formats, i.e. SRF 1.5.x
requires SMW 1.5.x.

For more information, see the SRF homepage at:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Result_Formats

== Included formats ==

=== icalendar ===

Enables exports of calendar entries (events) using the iCalendar format.
Using this format creates an according download link in the wiki.

=== vcard ===

Enables exports of contact data (email, phone, address, etc.) using the vCard
format. Using this format creates an according download link in the wiki.

=== bibtex ===

Enables exports of bibliographical reference data using the BibTeX format.
Using this format creates an according download link in the wiki.

=== calendar ===

Displays query results in a monthly calendar interface.

=== timeline ===

Displays query results in interactive timelines, displaying one or two dates
per query result.

=== eventline ===

Displays query results in interactive timelines, displaying an arbitrary number
of individual dates per query result.

=== outline ====

Displays query results in an "outline" form, using the values of one more
properties as the headers.

=== sum ===

Displays the sum of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== average ===

Displays the average of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== min ===

Displays the smallest of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== max ===

Displays the largest of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== googlepie ===

Creates a pie chart out of the numeric values of a specific property using
the Google Charts API. This format sends data to Google for formatting.

=== googlebar ===

Creates a bar chart out of the numeric values of a specific property using
the Google Charts API. This format sends data to Google for formatting.

=== jqplotpie ===

Creates a pie chart out of the numeric values of a specific property
using the jqPlot Javascript library.

=== jqplotbar ===

Creates a bar chart out of the numeric values of a specific property
using the jqPlot Javascript library.

=== exhibit ===

Creates an interactive browsing/filtering interface for displaying query
results. Various display modes are supported. One is Google Maps, which
requires data to be transmitted to Google.

=== ploticus ===

Creates a variety of graph types using the Ploticus application, which must be
installed (this format is currently disabled, due to a security hole).

=== graph ===

Creates a graph based on the relations in the wiki. Requires the GraphViz
extension.

=== gallery ===

Creates a gallery of images (and captions) dynamically. The output is the
same as when using MediaWiki's built-in <gallery>-tag.

=== tree, ultree, oltree ===

Format tree displays the query result as a tree, i.e. as an unordered (bulleted)
nested HTML list. ultree is an alias of tree. oltree produces an ordered
(numbered) list instead of an unordered list. 

=== filtered ===

Displays results in switchable views and offers client-side (JavaScript based)
filtering. (unfinished, e.g. no switching between views yet)

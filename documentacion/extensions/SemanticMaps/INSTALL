Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SemanticMaps/INSTALL?view=co


== Requirements ==

Semantic Maps requires:

* Maps with the same version as this release of Semantic Maps
** Validator 0.4.11 or above
** MediaWiki 1.17 or above
* PHP 5.2 or above, 5.3 or above recommended
* Semantic MediaWiki 1.7 or above

Semantic Maps also extensions these extensions when installed:

* Admin Links (any version)

== Download ==

You can find the current version of Semantic Maps on the Google Code download page [0],
as well as a list of legacy downloads [1].

[0] https://code.google.com/p/semanticmaps/downloads/list
[1] https://code.google.com/p/semanticmaps/downloads/list?can=1

You can also get the code directly from SVN. Tags can be obtained via

 svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/SemanticMaps/REL_version

Where 'version' is the version number of the tag, such as 0_1
(see the available tags at http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/SemanticMaps/).

The latest code can be obtained from trunk:

 svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SemanticMaps/

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''SemanticMaps'' directory within your MediaWiki
'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Semantic Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticMaps/SemanticMaps.php" );

You need to keep these rules in mind regarding the inclusion order of extenions:

* Validator needs to be included before any extension using it (so you can just put it first to keep it simple).
* Maps needs to be included before Semantic Maps.
* Semantic MediaWiki needs to be included before Maps.
* Semantic Forms (if used) needs to be included before Maps (but after SMW).

An example of a typical inclusion order: ..., Validator, ..., SMW, ..., SF, ..., Maps, SM, ...
